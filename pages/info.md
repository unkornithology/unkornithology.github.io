We do research on the ecology and evolution of live on Earth, with an emphasis on spatial ecology and biogeography. Our work predominately involves birds, but we use methods that are easily translatable to other taxonomic groups. Our work takes place all over the world, with an emphasis on the Great Plains and Central Africa. More information is available on the research page.

## Getting Involved

### Academics

If you are interested in getting hands-on research experience as an undergrad and attending a vibrant, active university in a small town in one of the best migration hotspots in the world, then [University of Nebraska at Kearney](https://www.unk.edu){:target="_blank"} may be for you!

### Where we are

[Kearney, Nebraska](https://visitkearney.org/){:target="_blank"}, sometimes referred to as the "[Sandhill Crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhill_crane){:target="_blank"} Capitol of the World", is located at the south end of Nebraska's Sandhills and on the left bank of the Platte River. We are adjacent to some of the largest remaining native grasslands in North America, and at the crossroads for birds from the western, eastern, and central parts of the North American continent.

Jacob C. Cooper created logos for this web page in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) using [Platagenet Cherokee](https://freefontsfamily.com/plantagenet-cherokee-font-free/), which is available for personal, non-commercial use, and available from other non-linked sites as well. The mini logo "ᏤᏏ" is an approximation of the pronounciation the initials "JC", one of the PI's initials, and (so far as JCC knows) does not correspond to any particular word or term.
