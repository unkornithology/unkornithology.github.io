The following is a list of potential projects for collaboration for undergraduate students. We are also open to other avenues of research, so feel free to contact us.

# Conservation

1. Niche ecology of endangered species
1. Niche dynamics of montane species
1. Niche dynamics of Great Plains species
1. Prairie-Dogs of Nebraska
1. Population dynamics in the central USA
1. Edge vs. block habitats
1. Improving target surveys for species
1. Locating species at range fringes

# Distributional Ecology

## Change through time

1. Resurvey of Nance County
1. Research on the collections of Nebraska, understanding how well internet resources represent the collections that were made
